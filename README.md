 This repository contains the Java programs for calculators that work specifically with fractions, along with comments and adherence to good coding practices.

 ## Resources Used

 - **Online Java Documentation**: I used the the official Java documentation (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/) to clarafy the usage of specific java methods and classes. It helped me understand how to work with strings, characters, and arrays in Java.
 - **StackOverflow**: When I encounted certain problems while coding (e.g. figuring out why certain packages were not importing/syntax errors from seperate classes), I went on StackOverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/) for some assistance.
 - **Online Java Style Guide**: I referred to the Google Java Style Guide (https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) to ensure consistent formatting and naming conventions, improving code readability.
 - **Online Markdown Guide**: This README.md file was created with the help of an online Markdown guide (https://www.markdownguide.org/), which provided information on Markdown syntax for effective documentation.
